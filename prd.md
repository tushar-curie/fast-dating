## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
FAST is a dating app designed for **India's "instant" culture**—quick commerce, reels, low attention spans. Instead of endless chatting, it makes **activity + availability + expectations** visible upfront, so people can move from match → meeting with minimal friction.

### 1.2 Core Philosophy: Activity-First, Not Partner-First
**The most important principle of FAST:** Intentions are never stated explicitly. Users don't declare they're "looking for a relationship" or "finding a partner"—that creates pressure and awkwardness.

Instead, users simply choose **activities they want to do** (pottery, coffee, live music, etc.). When two people share interest in the same activity, they can meet to do that activity together. The meeting feels natural because there's a pre-decided, shared purpose—not a high-stakes "date" evaluation.

> **Why this works:** "Let's do pottery together" feels lighter than "Let's see if we're compatible partners." The activity becomes the reason to meet, and any romantic connection emerges organically.

### 1.3 Core Value Proposition
**"Less talking, more meeting (without the awkwardness)."**

FAST is especially helpful for:
- **Busy professionals** who lack time for endless back-and-forth
- **Introverts** who struggle with performative chat dynamics

### 1.4 Key Differentiators
| Traditional Dating Apps | FAST |
|------------------------|------|
| Explicit "looking for relationship" labels | Activity-first matching—no stated romantic intent |
| Endless chatting before meeting | Shared activity gives natural reason to meet |
| Manual bio writing | Auto-generated introductions from quick questions |
| Ambiguous scheduling | Clear time slots visible on profiles |
| Ghosting cycles | Structured, low-pressure interactions |
| Catfishing risk | Quick alignment via video/voice call before meeting |

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 User Pain Points
| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Forced small talk** | Users spend excessive time on superficial conversations |
| **Planning fatigue** | Coordinating schedules is mentally exhausting |
| **Mental exhaustion** | Dating app interactions feel like a chore |
| **Ghosting cycles** | Conversations fizzle without real-world meetings |
| **Scheduling friction** | No clear way to align availability |
| **High-pressure framing** | "Looking for a partner" creates awkward expectations |
| **No reason to meet** | Without a shared activity, meetings feel like interviews |

### 2.2 How FAST Solves These Problems

|----------|----------------|
| **Activity-first matching** | Users choose activities they want to do; matches happen based on shared interests—no explicit "looking for partner" labels |

| **Clear expectations** | Bill preferences, activity types visible on profile |
| **Auto introductions & quick replies** | No typing required to start conversations |
| **Small talk made easy** | Pre-built conversation starters and quick responses |
| **Availability-led discovery** | Users see others' time slots based on distance settings; optional filter to show only people available in user's own time slot |
| **Introvert-friendly flow** | Structured interactions reduce social anxiety |
| **Quick alignment** | Video/voice call option to check the vibe and verify the person is genuine before meeting in person (anti-catfishing) |

## 5. Viral Growth & Distribution Strategy

### 5.1 Growth Philosophy

**The cold, hard truth:** Dating apps live or die by network density. You need enough attractive, available people in the same area at the same time, or the product is worthless. This isn't a "nice to have"—it's existential.

FAST's time-slot mechanic creates a unique constraint: we need people available at overlapping times. This means we need **10x the user density** of a typical dating app to deliver value.

**The good news:** This same constraint creates urgency and FOMO that can fuel viral growth—if we architect it correctly.

### 5.2 Viral Loop Architecture

#### Primary Viral Loop: "Tonight's Activity" Share
```
User sets availability → Sees "X people available for [activity] tonight" →
User has great meetup → Shares success → Friend downloads → Loop repeats
```

#### Secondary Viral Loop: "Activity Invite"
```
User wants to do activity → Not enough matches available →
Prompted to "Invite friends to unlock more people" →
Friend joins → Both users see expanded pool → Value delivered
```

#### Tertiary Viral Loop: "Waitlist FOMO"
```
User in waitlisted area → Sees "247 people ahead of you in Koramangala" →
User shares to unlock faster access → Friends join waitlist → Density builds before launch
```

### 5.3 K-Factor Optimization

| Metric | Target | Mechanism |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Invites sent per user** | 3+ | Activity invite prompts, unlock features |
| **Invite acceptance rate** | 25%+ | Pre-written messages, social proof |
| **Time to first invite** | <24 hours | Prompted after first match or activity |

### 5.4 Core Viral Features

#### Feature 1: Activity Heatmap (Social Proof Engine)
Show real-time activity to create urgency:
- "🔥 47 people available for Drinks tonight in Indiranagar"
- "☕ 23 people want Coffee this weekend in Koramangala"
- Numbers update in real-time
- **Critical:** Only show when numbers are impressive (>15 for an activity)

#### Feature 2: "Unlock More" Mechanic
When a user runs out of profiles to swipe:
- "Want to see more people available for [activity]?"
- "Invite 2 friends to unlock 20 more profiles"
- Alternative: "Share your availability to unlock"

#### Feature 3: Success Story Prompts
After a completed activity (user confirms they met):
- "How was drinks with Priya? 🍻"
- Options: "Amazing!" / "Good vibes" / "Not my type"
- If positive: "Your friends would love this. Share your experience?"
- Pre-written, privacy-safe share: "Just had a great time meeting someone new on FAST. Way better than endless texting 💬→🍻"

#### Feature 4: Neighborhood Leaderboard
- "Most active neighborhoods this week"
- Shows which areas have most activity
- Creates FOMO for users in less active areas
- Drives word-of-mouth in hot neighborhoods

#### Feature 5: "Your Friends on FAST" (Phase 2)
- Contact sync (optional, with clear privacy controls)
- "3 of your contacts are on FAST"
- Never reveal who—just the number
- Creates curiosity and normalizes usage

### 5.5 Anti-Viral Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Why It Kills Growth |
|---------|---------------------|
| Empty states | "No one available" destroys retention. Never show this. |
| Slow onboarding | Every extra second = 10% drop-off. Target <90 seconds to first swipe. |
| Requiring too much upfront | 4 photos is aggressive. Consider 2 required, 2 optional. |
| No immediate value | User must see appealing profiles within first session or they churn. |
| Generic sharing | "Share FAST" doesn't work. Share moments, not apps. |

### 5.6 Network Effect Multipliers

#### Density Thresholds
| User Density | User Experience |
|--------------|-----------------|
| <100 users/neighborhood | **Unusable.** User sees few/no matches. |
| 100-500 users/neighborhood | **Marginal.** Occasional matches, high churn risk. |
| 500-2000 users/neighborhood | **Good.** Regular matches, product works. |
| 2000+ users/neighborhood | **Excellent.** Real-time availability matching. |

**Strategy implication:** Launch narrow and deep. One neighborhood at 2000 users beats 10 neighborhoods at 200 users each.

## 6. Launch Playbook

### 6.1 Pre-Launch Phase: Build Density Before Opening

#### Waitlist Strategy
1. **Landing page** with area selection
2. **"Your area isn't live yet"** message with waitlist signup
3. **Show position in line** for their specific area
4. **Unlock faster access** by sharing/inviting friends

#### Waitlist Viral Mechanics
| Action | Reward |
|--------|--------|
| Sign up | Position #X in line |
| Share unique link | Move up 10 spots per signup |
| 3 friends join | Guaranteed early access |
| 10 friends join | VIP access + profile boost |

#### Target Density Before Launch
- Minimum 500 waitlist signups per neighborhood before going live
- Ideal: 1000+ signups with 60%+ completing pre-registration

### 6.2 Launch Sequence: City-by-City, Neighborhood-by-Neighborhood

#### Phase 1: Bangalore Pilot (Weeks 1-8)
| Week | Focus Area | Target Users |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1-2 | Indiranagar only | 500 active |
| 3-4 | Indiranagar + Koramangala | 1500 active |
| 5-6 | Add HSR Layout | 3000 active |
| 7-8 | Full Bangalore (6 neighborhoods) | 6000 active |

#### Phase 2: Expansion (Weeks 9-16)
- Mumbai launch (same neighborhood-by-neighborhood approach)
- Delhi NCR launch
- Hyderabad launch

### 6.3 Launch Day Tactics

#### "Launch Night" Event Mechanic
For each neighborhood launch:
1. All waitlisted users get access at same time (7 PM on a Thursday/Friday)
2. **"Launch Night Special"**: First 2 hours, everyone's availability is set to "Tonight"
3. Creates immediate activity surge and matches
4. Users who match during launch get "Founding Member" badge

#### First 48 Hours
| Hour | Action |
|------|--------|
| 0 | Open access, send "You're in!" notification |
| 2 | Send "X people available tonight in [area]" |
| 24 | "Yesterday's stats: X meetups happened in [area]" |
| 48 | "This weekend: X people planning activities" |

### 6.4 Cold Start Solutions

#### Problem: New user signs up, no one is available
**Solutions:**
1. **Stagger availability display**: Show profiles with upcoming availability (next 48-72 hours), not just "right now"
2. **"Notify me" option**: "No one's available for Drinks tonight. Get notified when someone is?"
3. **Activity scheduling**: "Set your availability for later this week and we'll match you"
4. **Never show zero**: If <3 profiles available, show a friendly "More people coming soon! Invite friends to speed it up"

#### Problem: Gender imbalance (common in dating apps)
**Solutions:**
1. **Women-first access**: Give women earlier access to build the more valuable side first
2. **Activity-based framing**: Position as "activity partners" not "dating" in initial marketing
3. **Women-only referrals**: Let women earn rewards for inviting other women
4. **Quality control**: More aggressive filtering on male profiles initially

## 7. Notification Strategy

### 7.1 Notification Philosophy

**Rule #1:** Every notification must deliver value or create anticipation. No "engagement bait."

**Rule #2:** Notifications are the primary re-engagement mechanism. Master this or die.

**Rule #3:** Timing matters more than content. A mediocre notification at the right time beats a perfect notification at the wrong time.

### 7.2 Notification Types & Triggers

#### Tier 1: High-Priority (Always Send)
| Trigger | Notification | Timing |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| New match | "You matched with [Name]! You both want [Activity]" | Immediate |
| Message received | "[Name]: [Message preview]" | Immediate |
| Call request received | "[Name] wants to do a quick call before meeting" | Immediate |
| Match available NOW | "☕ [Name] is available for Coffee right now in [Area]" | Immediate |

#### Tier 2: Engagement (Smart Timing)
| Trigger | Notification | Timing |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Unread matches | "You have 3 matches waiting. [Name] is available tonight" | 6 PM local |
| Popular time approaching | "🔥 Peak time for Drinks in [Area] starts in 2 hours" | 5 PM Fri/Sat |
| Activity surge | "23 people just set availability for [Activity] tonight" | Real-time when threshold hit |
| Match's availability starting | "[Name] is available starting now" | When their time slot begins |

#### Tier 3: Re-engagement (Lapsed Users)
| Trigger | Notification | Timing |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| 3 days inactive | "Miss us? 12 new people in [Area] want [Their top activity]" | 6 PM |
| 7 days inactive | "People are meeting up without you. [X] activities happened this week" | Weekend morning |
| Match went inactive | "Looks like [Name] hasn't been active. Keep swiping?" | After 48 hours |

### 7.3 Time-Slot Specific Notifications

**The killer feature of FAST:** Notifications tied to real-time availability.

| Scenario | Notification | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Match becomes available | "🟢 [Name] is available NOW for Drinks" | Creates urgency, drives immediate action |
| Availability overlap | "You and [Name] are both free 7-9 PM. Message them!" | Removes scheduling friction |
| Peak time alert | "Tonight's the night! 34 people available for activities in [Area]" | Social proof + urgency |
| Upcoming availability | "Your availability starts in 1 hour. Ready to meet someone?" | Primes the user |

### 7.4 Notification Timing Rules

| Day | Best Times | Avoid |
|-----|------------|-------|
| Mon-Thu | 12-1 PM, 6-8 PM | Before 10 AM, after 10 PM |
| Friday | 12-1 PM, 4-7 PM | After 9 PM (they're out) |
| Saturday | 11 AM-1 PM, 4-6 PM | Morning (sleeping), late night |
| Sunday | 11 AM-2 PM, 5-7 PM | Evening (prep for Monday) |

### 7.5 Notification Caps

| Type | Daily Max | Weekly Max |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Match notifications | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Message notifications | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Engagement notifications | 2 | 8 |
| Re-engagement notifications | 1 | 3 |

### 7.6 Push vs. In-App Notifications

| Content | Push | In-App | SMS (backup) |
|---------|------|--------|--------------|
| New match | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| New message | ✓ | ✓ | After 1 hour unread |
| Availability reminder | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| Activity surge | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| Weekly digest | - | ✓ | - |

- Options: 5-minute voice call / 5-minute video call / No preference
- This preference is shown on the user's profile
- When both users have selected a call preference, the chat interface prominently suggests scheduling a quick call before the activity

#### Step 6: Activity Selection (Core Matching Criteria)
**This is the heart of FAST's matching logic.** Users select activities they genuinely want to do. Matches are shown based on shared activity interest.

- Activities: Coffee, Movie, Drinks, Dinner, Comedy show, Walk, Museum, Live music, Board games, Dessert, Mental health talk, Books/cafe, Fitness date, Pottery, Cooking class, Art gallery
- Users can select multiple activities
- Discovery prioritizes users who share at least one activity preference
- The shared activity is displayed prominently on match profiles

#### Step 7: Area Selection
- User types area name
- **Bottom sheet** displays:
  - Typed area + distance from current location (e.g., "Indiranagar — 2 km")
  - 3 nearby area suggestions (e.g., Indiranagar, Koramangala, HSR)
- Use Bangalore areas only for prototype

#### Onboarding Completion
- Full-screen success message: *"You're all set! Find someone who wants to do what you love."*
- Modern illustration/animation in neon-dark theme
- Emphasizes activity, not "dating" or "finding a partner"

### 8.4 Discovery & Matching

#### Matching Philosophy
Users are matched based on **shared activities**, not explicit relationship intent. When you see a profile, it means:
1. You both want to do at least one of the same activities
2. They are within your distance settings
3. Their availability is visible (so you can see if times might work)

#### Session-Based Discovery Setup
Before browsing profiles, users set their **intent for this session**:
1. **Select activity for now:** Choose what they want to do right now (e.g., "Drinks," "Coffee")
2. **Set availability:** Pick a time slot for today (e.g., "7:00 PM – 9:00 PM")

This session filter narrows discovery to profiles that match the selected activity. Users can change these settings anytime from the discovery screen header.

> **Example:** Priya opens the app at 5:30 PM, sets availability for 7–9 PM today, and selects "Drinks." She now sees profiles of people who also selected "Drinks" as an activity.

#### Availability-Led Discovery
- Users see other profiles' **time slots** based on their distance settings
- **Default behavior:** All profiles within distance are shown with their availability visible, **regardless of time slot overlap**
- Users can match with someone even if time slots don't perfectly align (they can negotiate timing in chat)
- **Optional filter:** "Show only people available in my time slot" narrows results to overlapping availability
- This filter is accessible from the discovery screen header

#### Profile Cards
- Generate **100+ fake profiles** with varied:
  - Availability times
  - Shared activity interests (the reason for the match)
  - Personality answers
- Each profile displays **4 photos**
- **Photo navigation:** Tap to advance to next photo (Tinder-style)
- **Shared activities badge:** Prominently shows which activities you both selected

#### Interaction Model
- **Primary interaction:** Swipe gestures (swipe right to like, swipe left to unlike)
- **Alternative:** Like/Unlike buttons (thumbs/tick/cross style) for users who prefer tapping
- **Unlike animation:** Card flies left (trash-like motion)
- **Like animation:** Card flies right with golden glow accent
- **Auto-sent introduction:** When user likes a profile, their auto-generated intro is automatically sent
- After like: Show popup *"Your intro has been sent to {Name}"* for 5 seconds
- **Match popup:** Display for 1 out of every 3 likes
- Do NOT auto-navigate to chat after like

### 8.5 Matches Screen

#### Display Requirements
- Show **name** prominently
- Show **shared activity** (e.g., "Both want: Pottery, Coffee")
- Show **availability as time range** (e.g., "6–8 PM", "7–9 PM")
- Shared activity + availability slot are the key decision factors for who to message first

### 8.6 Chat Screen

#### Header
- Display: **Name, Age, Shared Activity, Availability slot**
- Profile photo tap → Opens full profile
- Shared activity shown as badge (e.g., "🍻 Drinks")

#### Auto-Received Introduction
- When opening a chat, the user sees the **other person's auto-generated intro** already displayed
- This creates immediate context without requiring manual first messages

#### Quick Reply System (Minimal Typing Flow)
The chat offers **tap-to-communicate** via quick reply chips for common responses. Manual typing is **always available** for users who prefer it.

**Quick Reply Categories:**

| Category | Example Quick Replies |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Meeting Intent** | "Are you up for meeting today?" / "Want to meet this week?" |
| **Availability Confirmation** | "Yes, that time works!" / "Can we do a bit later?" |
| **Venue Discussion Starters** | "Yes, but where do you want to meet?" / "Any place you prefer?" |
| **Activity-Specific** | "Want to grab drinks at [time]?" / "Coffee sounds great!" |
| **Send Introduction** | Sends the auto-generated intro from Bio Builder |

**Design principle:** Quick replies reduce friction for common exchanges, but the keyboard is always accessible. Users can type freely at any point in the conversation.

#### Venue Discussion
Once both users agree to meet:
1. Users suggest specific venues via chat (e.g., "How about Toit in Indiranagar?")
2. Users exchange venue suggestions and finalize timing

#### Quick Alignment (Anti-Catfishing)
**Purpose:** Let users verify the other person's vibe and authenticity before meeting in person.

- **Call request flow:**
  1. User taps "Request Call" button (voice or video)
  2. Other user receives call request notification in chat
  3. Other user taps "Accept" or "Decline"
  4. If accepted, call initiates immediately
- If both users have selected a call preference in their profile, show banner: "You both prefer a quick call before meeting—schedule one?"
- Call acts as vibe check before committing to in-person activity
- On-screen keyboard visible for realism

### 8.7 Time & Calendar

#### Availability Selection
- Remove "now" from time slot options
- Calendar picker for **next 7 days**
- Time ranges (not single times)

### 8.8 Time-Based Urgency & FOMO Mechanics

These features leverage FAST's unique time-slot mechanic to create urgency and drive action.

#### Expiring Availability Windows
- When a user's availability window is ending: "⏰ [Name]'s availability ends in 30 minutes"
- Creates urgency to message/meet before the window closes
- Match cards show countdown for users available "right now"

#### "Available Now" Priority
- Profiles of users currently in their availability window get **priority placement**
- Visual indicator: Pulsing green dot + "Available now until 9 PM"
- These profiles appear first in discovery feed

#### "Tonight's Last Call"
- At 8 PM: Show banner "Last chance for tonight! 12 people still available"
- Creates end-of-day urgency for users who haven't made plans

## 10. Design System & Brand Guidelines

### 10.1 Brand Identity

#### Brand Positioning
- **Premium, confident, modern, distraction-free focus** (Black)
- **Speed, energy, "instant action," high clarity** (Neon)

#### Logo Direction
- Logo mark + FAST wordmark (not text-only)
- Style: Modern, minimal, geometric
- Cues: Speed / lightning / forward motion
- Neon treatment: Soft glow, not harsh

#### Glow Rules
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Glow color | `#BEEE02` |
| Outer glow | 12–20px blur, 20–35% opacity |
| Inner glow (optional) | 6–10px blur, 12–18% opacity |
| Application | Logo and key active elements only—never large backgrounds |

### 10.2 Color Palette

#### Primary Colors
| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Black (Base) | `#0F1008` | Primary background |
| Neon Accent | `#BEEE02` | CTAs, active states, highlights |

#### Supporting Neutrals
| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Text on dark | `#F5F7EB` | Primary text |
| Muted text | `#A7AD93` | Secondary text, labels |
| Surface/Card | `#17180F` | Card backgrounds, elevated surfaces |
| Divider | `rgba(190, 238, 2, 0.12)` | Separators, borders |

#### Neon Usage Rules
- **Use for:** Primary CTAs, active states, key highlights, focus rings, progress/selection indicators
- **Avoid:** Large background areas—neon is the "spark," not the wallpaper
- High contrast improves scannability and supports rapid decisions

### 10.3 Typography

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| Display/H1 | 28–32px | Semibold | 130% |
| H2 | 20–22px | Semibold | 130% |
| Body | 15–16px | Regular | 150% |
| Caption/Meta | 12–13px | Medium | 140% |

### 10.4 Layout & Spacing

**Grid:** 8pt grid throughout

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Screen padding | 16px left/right |
| Section spacing | 24px between major blocks |
| Component spacing | 12–16px between related elements |
| Safe top padding | 16–24px (device dependent) |

### 10.5 Component Specifications

#### Buttons
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Height | 48–52px |
| Corner radius | 14–18px |
| Horizontal padding | 16–20px |
| Disabled opacity | 40–50% |

#### Cards

| Radius | 18–24px |
| Padding | 16–20px |
| Shadow | Minimal; use surface color for elevation |

#### Inputs
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Height | 48–52px |
| Radius | 14–16px |
| Focus ring | 2px neon outline (`#BEEE02`) with subtle glow |

#### Dividers
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Height | 1px |
| Color | Low-opacity neon-tinted or neutral |

## 11. Appendix

### 11.1 Glossary
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Activity-first matching | Core FAST philosophy: users match based on shared activities (not explicit relationship intent), creating natural reasons to meet |
| Auto-sent introduction | When a user likes a profile, their auto-generated bio is automatically sent to that person |
| Availability-led discovery | Users see other profiles' time slots based on distance settings; optional filter narrows to overlapping availability only |
| Bio Builder | Feature that generates user bios from quick questionnaire responses |
| Quick Alignment | Pre-meeting video/voice call to verify the other person's vibe and authenticity (anti-catfishing measure) |
| Quick reply system | Tap-to-communicate chat interface using pre-built response options; minimizes typing in early conversation |
| Session-based filtering | Setting activity and availability for the current browsing session before swiping |
| Shared Activity | The activity both users have selected (e.g., pottery, coffee), displayed prominently as the reason for the match |
| Venue discussion phase | Chat phase where users suggest and agree on specific meeting locations |
| Activity Heatmap | Real-time display showing user counts per activity, creating social proof and urgency |
| K-Factor | Viral coefficient measuring how many new users each existing user brings |
| Network Density | Number of active users per neighborhood; critical threshold for product value |
| Waitlist Mechanic | Pre-launch system that builds user density before opening an area |
| FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) | Psychological driver used in urgency features to prompt action |
| Launch Night | Coordinated release event where all waitlisted users get access simultaneously |
| Unlock More | Referral-gated feature that reveals additional profiles after friend invites |

### 11.2 Out of Scope (v1.0)
- Payment/subscription features
- Real location services (prototype uses hardcoded Bangalore areas)
- Real OTP verification
- Backend matching algorithm
- Profile verification
- Contact sync ("Your Friends on FAST")

### 11.3 Future Considerations
- Expand to other Tier 1 cities (Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad)
- Add women-focused safety features
- Implement premium tiers
- Add group date features
- Integrate with calendar apps
- Contact sync for social proof ("3 friends on FAST")
- Cross-city matching for travelers
- Activity venue partnerships
- In-app activity booking

### 11.4 Sample User Journey

This end-to-end example illustrates how FAST is intended to be used:

---

**User:** Priya (looking to meet someone for drinks tonight)

**5:30 PM — Session Setup**
1. Priya logs into FAST
2. She sets her availability: **7:00 PM – 9:00 PM today**
3. She selects her activity: **"Drinks"**

**5:32 PM — Discovery**
4. Priya starts swiping through profiles filtered by "Drinks" activity
5. Each profile shows the person's availability time slot (may or may not overlap with hers)
6. She swipes left on 10 profiles that don't interest her

**5:35 PM — Finding a Match**
7. On the 11th profile, she sees **Rahul**—a nice-looking guy whose bio resonates with her
8. Rahul's availability is **9:00 PM – 11:00 PM** (different from her slot)
9. Despite the time mismatch, she's interested—she swipes right
10. Popup appears: *"Your intro has been sent to Rahul"*

**5:36 PM — Chat Begins**
11. Priya opens the chat with Rahul
12. She sees Rahul's **auto-generated intro** already displayed (no waiting for first message)
13. Priya taps a quick reply: **"Are you up for meeting today?"**
14. Rahul responds with quick reply: **"Yes, but where do you want to meet?"**

**5:38 PM — Venue Discussion**
15. Now they discuss where to meet
16. Priya types: "How about Toit in Indiranagar?"
17. Rahul replies: "Perfect, see you at 8:30?"
18. They negotiate a time that works for both (between their availability windows)

**5:40 PM — Quick Alignment Call**
19. Priya wants to verify Rahul's vibe before meeting
20. She taps **"Request Call"** (voice)
21. Rahul receives the request and taps **"Accept"**
22. They have a quick 5-minute call
23. Priya feels confident and confirms the plan on the call

**8:30 PM — Activity Together**
24. Priya and Rahul meet for drinks 🍻

---

**Key Observations from This Journey:**
- Total time from login to confirmed plan: ~15 minutes
- Quick replies accelerated the early conversation; manual typing used for venue specifics
- Time slot mismatch didn't prevent matching—they negotiated in chat
- Quick Alignment call provided confidence before meeting in person
- The "activity" (drinks) provided natural context for the meeting
